# StringFilter

# StringFilter

This project contains a program that filters strings from an input array, returning only those strings that are 3 characters long or shorter.

## How it works

The program iterates over each string in the initial array, checks its length, and adds it to a new array if the length is less than or equal to 3 characters.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the program.
3. Input an array of strings when prompted.

## Example

Input: `["Hello", "2", "world", ":-)"]`  
Output: `["2", ":-)"]`
